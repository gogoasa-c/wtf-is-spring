## Did you read all the other introduction markdown files in all the other folders? 

If yes, then you're ready to have a look through the file structure
for the Spring Boot project.

If not, you should probably go back and read them! They're pretty cool...

**Note**: the example project is the backend for AidAtlas, developed during 
the SISC x Nable 12-hour hackathon. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/gogoasa-c/crusaders-nable).
You should look under the back-end directory for the Spring Boot project.

I've decided against including the project in this repository, since it's a bit too big and makes things cumbersome.

So, the simplest way to go about it would be:

```
git clone https://github.com/gogoasa-c/crusaders-nable.git
```

And also make sure you're on the 'backend' branch, since that's where the project is located. Just do:

```
git switch backend
```
